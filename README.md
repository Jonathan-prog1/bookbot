BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

this project lets you know how many words that book has and how many letters that book has.

## To use it:

1. Make sure you have a folder called books in the main folder.
2. Add books to the book folder.
3. in the main folder of BookBoot type (main.py books/name of your book you want to see the stats on.
